# Big Brother

## Overview

Big Brother is a Discord bot that watches users play a simulated stock market game to track large amounts of data. It gives intuitive user analytics and maximizes user profit. The project has been in active development since 2020. The bot now supports over **100,000 users**.

The name is inspired by George Orwell's *1984*, where "Big Brother" is always watching.

Its primary purpose is to analyze trends in user data such as stock purchases, activity, stock market prices, and more. We put an emphasis on seamless automation so the inner workings are entirely hidden from the user and requires as little human intervention as possible. Set it and forget it!

*The best software should do everything it's required to (and more) without being noticed!*

## Development Details

This project was made using the DiscordJS library, based on NodeJS to develop the bot. 

The backend server was developed using NodeJS and Express, it connects to a MongoDB database.

I use Docker to bundle the projects into containers. They are deployed in an AWS EC2 instance, we used Heroku and DigitalOcean as well.

The project is supported by our generous patrons, the project would not be possible without them. Our Patreon page can be found [HERE](https://www.patreon.com/bigbrotherbot).
